# Cracking the Coding Interview Prep
### About
I am working through the Cracking the Coding Interview book. I also have a section solving practice problems from Leet Code, Code Wars, and other websites.

### Why
To practice technical interview skills, build confidence in my programming skills, and showcase my problem-solving abilities.

You can follow along with my journey of learning new data types and built in methods, comparing and contrasting Javascript and Python.

### The Languages I'm Using
I am solving problems in both JavaScript and Python.

### Repo Organization and How to Navigate
I broke each chapter into folders that clump together problems of the same type. Each problem is in their own file, and each folder has a README explaning what I learned through doing the problems in that chapter.

Each problem is clearly listed at the top and each solution has comments detailing my thoughts, time complexity with explanations, as well as test cases. 

Other sections include observations, examples, text answers, and ways to improve my solution.

### Other Information
I did most of the problems in Javascript to practice vanilla Javascript syntax, and the rest were done in Python for simplicity.

I chose these sections of the book because I thought they most closely related to what I would find in job interviews and on the job.
