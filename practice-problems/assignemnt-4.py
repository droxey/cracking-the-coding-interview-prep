# Rotate a given linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes, where k is a given integer.

# What clarifying questions would you ask?
# Is it a singly linked list or doubly linked?
# Is there a tail pointer or just a head pointer

# What reasonable assumptions could you state?
# I am assuming its a singly linked list and that there is a head pointer

# What are 2-3 ways you can simplify the problem?
# Instead of rotating k nodes I could rotate once to simplify

# Brainstorm 2-3 ways to approach the problem.
# to rotate counter clockwise, get rid of the connection
# between the head and the second node, make the head the new
# tail and make the second node the new head

# Choose one idea and write pseudocode for it.
